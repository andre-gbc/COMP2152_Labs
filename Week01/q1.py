# Defining Variables: Define an array variable with elements 1, 4, 7, 9
my_array = [1, 4, 7, 9]

# Order of Operations
a = 1
b = 2
c = 3
d = 4

# Fully-Bracketed Version:
e = ((a - ((b ** c) // d)) + (a % c))

# Formatting: Create variable and print with format function
temperature = 32.6
print("The temperature today is: {:.3f} degrees Celsius".format(temperature))

# Common Functions: User input and manipulation
userAge = int(input("Please enter your age: "))
userAge = userAge + 22
